Potential factors that affect COVID-19 results

This repo contains three folders: scripts, inputs and outputs. Script shows the process of importing and cleaning data. Inputs folder includes both original and cleaned dataset, as well as datasheet. Outputs folder includes the rmd and pdf formats of the paper. The paper analyzes the factors that affect the results of COVID-19 cases in Toronto. By creating some visualizations and applying binomial regression models, we found outbreak-associated, age, gender, infection source, classification type, ever hospitalized, ever in ICU, ever intubated are correlated to the recovery/fatality of the COVID-19 cases. The paper can provide a pathway for the prevention of the pandemic.
